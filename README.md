# Active Directory in Azure Lab

This project demonstrates how to deploy a fully functional Windows Active Directory environment inside Microsoft Azure using virtual machines, virtual networking, and DNS configuration.  
It simulates an on-premises domain controller and client workstation in a cloud-hosted environment — a common setup for cybersecurity, system administration, and enterprise IT training.
